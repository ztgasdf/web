<p>Well, this is yet another blog handcrafted by me. A few hours of painful palette selection and messing with hues and saturation brought me to this colour scheme, which I personally think looks alright to the eyes.</p>
<p>Everything from the favicon to the CSS to the font is consistent, and I am glad that I was able to accomplish something like that for once.</p>
<p>Two things to note:</p>

<ul><li>CSS is internal, and not external.</li>
<li>The font colour <i>might</i> be too dark.</li></ul>

<p>All of these are subjective, and probably won't be changed unless someone other than myself complains about it.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Next time, I will talk about something else. See you around, and take care as always.</p>
