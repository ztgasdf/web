<body>|---------------------who am i?----------------------|
| i'm not really sure myself. my name is tess, born  |
| and raised in southern new jersey, and i am 18y/o. |
| i like listening to music, and i usually play cs:s |
| and/or csgo in my free time. i still live with my  |
| family and siblings, and i still care for them.    |
|                                                    |
| i'm trans and a furry (cat), and i try to help all |
| who need support or help. i may not know what to do|
| or say at times, but i at least try to listen to   |
| the troubles that my friends have to deal with on  |
| a day to day basis.                                |
|                                                    |
| on a more personal side, i am an SA victim.        |
| i suffer from mood swings and violent nightmares   |
| almost everyday, but i'm trying my best to never   |
| let that affect me or anyone around me. i am also  |
| quite religious, and i feel confident in attesting |
| that my faith has kept me going, pushing me forward|
| to a hopefully better future.                      |
|                                                    |
| i may not be the best at talking, but if you ever  |
| want to add me, feel free to and maybe we can have |
| a nice talk. thank you for coming and taking the   |
| time to read all of this. xoxo <3         -- tess  |
